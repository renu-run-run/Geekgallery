# GeekGallery


Geek Gallery is a stock photography website that exclusively utilizes the Unsplash API for its images, which can be conveniently searched by name. In the development process, I implemented the data fetching functionality using Axios, while also leveraging the principles of prop drilling and state lifting. The website is built on React JS and incorporates the sleek Material UI design system as part of its tech stack.
